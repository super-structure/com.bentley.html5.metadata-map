# Markdown DITA Topic

---
resourceid:
  - HelpID5-markdown

This is a very simply markdown topic with DITA metadata.

The plug-in doesn't pull resourceid values out of markdown topics yet, though.

Also, it doesn't appear that the DITA OT is properly parsing the YAML metadata block as defined in [Markdown DITA syntax](https://www.dita-ot.org/dev/reference/markdown/markdown-dita-syntax#metadata)
